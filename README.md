## Stock Reservation Flow

```
Sales Order Approved
      │
      ▼
fn_reserve_stock_for_so_v2
      │
      ├─ Sufficient stock ──→ status = 'stock_reserved'
      │
      └─ Insufficient stock → status = 'shortage'
                               + Import Requirements created

Delivery Challan Created  → stock reserved (not yet deducted)
Delivery Challan Approved → stock deducted from current_stock

SO Cancelled / Delivered / Closed
      │
      ▼
trigger_auto_release_on_so_status
      │
      ▼
fn_release_reservation_by_so_id
(sets status = 'released' AND is_released = true)
```

## User Roles

| Role | Access |
|---|---|
| `admin` | Full access to all modules |
| `sales` | CRM, Sales Orders, Customers, Delivery Challans |

## Storage Buckets

| Bucket | Contents |
|---|---|
| `product-source-documents` | Product grade/source documents (CoA, etc.) |

| `sales-order-documents` | Customer PO uploads |

All documents are served via **signed URLs** (1-hour TTL) and displayed in an **inline iframe viewer** — no popup windows.

---

## Developer Notes

- All stock changes go through DB triggers and RPCs. Never update `batches.current_stock` directly.
- Credit notes only restore stock when **approved** — not on creation.
- Payment vouchers use the `save_payment_voucher` RPC for full atomicity.
- Voucher numbers use `generate_voucher_number(prefix)` with advisory locks — safe under concurrent saves.
- The `trg_sync_batch_reserved_stock` trigger is the single source of truth for `batches.reserved_stock`. Always set `status = 'released'` (not just `is_released = true`) when releasing reservations, or they will still count as reserved.
